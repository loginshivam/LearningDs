Selection sort - 
	1- Find minimum replace with current element.
	2- go to next element.
	3- complexity - n2  for i 0 ->n for j i->n

Bubble sort - 
	1 - check if element is greater than next and replace. after this largest will be at the end 
	2-  go to next loop check and replace larger one by one
	   for i 0 -> n for j 0->n-1-i
